The mod when fully finished will include all of Chino's FNF animations in a playable form. As well as some fan made extras.

### Mod Update Roadmap:

- v1.1 - Hex's Electric Fight
- v1.2 - Chara's Knife Fight
- v1.5 - Dark Sonic vs BF Blitz Fight
- v1.7.5 - Extras!
- v2.0 - Matt's Boxing Fight

### Q&A:

- <b>Why isn't Updike's songs in the mod?</b>
<i>Because Updike's artist, Sock.Clip banned the use of updike in FNF mods.</i>
- <b>Why aren't all the updates released in one big update?</b>
<i>Because then the mod would take 10+ years to release.</i>
- <b>Where should I report a bug?</b>
